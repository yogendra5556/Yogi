subheading: This is a server-rendered page. The date it was last dynamically-rendered is shown above.

## Response headers

This page was rendered with the following headers:

```js
{
  "Cache-Control": "public, max-age=0, must-revalidate",
  "Netlify-CDN-Cache-Control": "public, max-age=31536000, must-revalidate",
  "Cache-Tag": "/revalidation,all-ssr-pages"
}
```

This gets interpreted differently by the browser and CDN:

- **Browsers:** a non-cacheable page, must be revalidated on every request
- **CDN:** cacheable for up to a year, though it will be automatically purged and revalidated on new deployments by default

## Cache tags

The `Cache-Tag` header, in tandem with the [purge API](https://docs.netlify.com/platform/caching/#on-demand-invalidation), allows a developer to invalidate any
content at will (pages, JSON responses, etc.) based on the tags associated with them.

Tags are completely up to you to decide on, and allow for powerful caching patterns.

## Stale-While-Revalidate

In real-world applications, you may want to use [stale-while-revalidate](https://docs.netlify.com/platform/caching/#stale-while-revalidate-directive) as well, so that end-users don't experience
a performance hit as pages are being rebuilt.
